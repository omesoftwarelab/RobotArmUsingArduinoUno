This stepping motor can be made into a bipolar stepping motor by changing the internal circuit pattern. 
Bajdi changed it to bipolar and uses it, but I use it as unipolar in this repository.

The electrical circuit is shown in circuit1.jpeg and circuit2.jpeg. The required parts list is shown in parts.txt.

The schematic of the robot arm controller is shown in controller-circuit.png. The parts list is shown in controller-parts.txt.
