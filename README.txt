3D printing "Stepper robot arm"ã€€was uploaded by Bajdi August 17, 2015. (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:970881)

This stepping motor can be made into a bipolar stepping motor by changing the internal circuit pattern. 
Bajdi changed it to bipolar and uses it, but I use it as unipolar in this repository.

The electrical circuit is shown in circuit1.jpg and circuit2.jpg. The schematic of the robot arm controller is shown in circuit3.jpg. 
The parts list is shown in Parts_list.pdf.
